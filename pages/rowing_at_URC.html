      <h2>Rowing at URC</h2>
      <p>
        We're proud to carry forward the objectives of our 150 year old club: "the promotion of rowing for the
        recreation
        of
        the members" - in short, row well, row hard, and have fun with a great group of people.

        Union welcomes anyone who would like to get in a boat and enjoy the camaraderie that comes from being part of a
        rowing club.

        <h2>Masters women and men</h2>
        <p>
          Union has large masters women and men squads rowing regularly throughout the year in both sweep oar and
          sculls.
          If
          you've rowed before, however long ago, there's a place for you in the squad.

          The level of commitment is completely over to the individual rower, whether they want to enjoy recreational
          rowing
          on a Sunday or complete solid competitive training programmes for regatta preparation under the expert
          direction
          of coach Jim Little.

          Union masters crews compete in several regattas in the RNZ calendar. They also row at South Island Masters
          [Queens
          Birthday], NZ Masters [September], as well as long distance events at Kaiapoi and the Reach. Crews have
          previously
          entered the Labour Weekend Cromwell to Clyde long distance race too.

          Union masters raced very successfully at the World Masters Games at Karapiro in April 2017. Crews have also
          entered the Australian Masters Champs and Head of the Yarra event in Melbourne.
        </p>
        <h3>Masters novices</h3>
        <p>
          Never rowed before? Union is the place to start your rowing career. We welcome new rowers of all ages and
          levels
          of physical ability, as we believe that rowing is a sport for all to enjoy.

          We usually begin our novice training sessions in late spring, and run regular training sessions throughout the
          season. Under the guidance of experienced rowers you will learn the fundamentals of a good rowing technique,
          as
          well as important health and safety practices. Once a certain level of competence is reached, new rowers can
          decide how they want to continue with the sport. We offer rowing at recreational as well as competitive level,
          and
          offer ongoing training for all.

        <h2>Club Rowing</h2>
        <p>Union rowing club also offers rowing to high school and university age men and women in the Christchurch area
          in both sweep and scull oars. The club rowing season starts in september and continues until midway through
          February, but winter rowing is also available. This summer season encompasses several on water training
          seasons
          a week, coached by our expert coach stuart wade, and about 4-5 regattas per year usually culminating in the NZ
          national club regatta at the end of the season.

      <h2>Adaptive rowers</h2>
      <p>
        We offer an adaptive rowing option (also known as para rowing). This is targeted at rowers who have a
        disability
        and
        the rowing coaching and/or equipment is adapted accordingly. Currently we have a small group training on the
        rowing
        machines onTuesday evenings. The group also raised money last year to purchase of a new wide-hulled four. This
        enables rowers to learn to row in a stable boat, so they can concentrate on learning the technique of rowing
        rather
        than on their balance.

        There are two coaches currently assisting with the adaptive rowing programme. Our goal for this year is to
        fund
        raise for a fixed seat single to provide an option for rowers with a physical impairment. There are
        opportunities
        for adaptive rowers to become involved on a social or a competitive basis.

        We have been involved in adaptive rowing since 2009 when the club ran a two year pilot for Rowing NZ to assist
        with
        the development of adaptive rowing in New Zealand. The Club also produced New Zealand's first international
        adaptive
        rower when Robin Tinga competed at the World Rowing Champs in Poznan in 2009.

        To find out more about the adaptive rowing programme please contact Karen Rickerby at (03) 942-2389.

      <h2>URC President's Club</h2>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">
        The President's Club is a great opportunity to keep in touch with Union rowing. Whether you're an ex-Union
        rower,
        a supporter or friend of the club, the President's Club is the way to be part of our Union community.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">-URC President Dorle Pauli</p>
      <p>
        The presidents club was created to give union supporters, ex rowers or anyone who wants to an oppurtunty to
        support the club and give back though a reduced memebership cost of $125. Your President's club subscription
        goes towards maintaining and improving our equipment and facilities, giving new generations of rowers the
        opportunity to row with pride in the best equipped club on the Reach. But URC presients club members also still
        involved in the club:
      </p>
      <h3>On the Water</h3>
      <p>
        There are several President's Club events during the year. President's Club members can be as active as they
        want to be.

        There'll be regular opportunities to join us at the Reach and get out on the water. For those keen to get back
        in a boat and show that none of that rowing talent has disappeared, there are ten Sunday morning paddles once a
        month from February to November. You can jump on an erg if you'd prefer too.

        The dates for these will be set for the year so that you can get them in your diary. They'll be on the high tide
        for the good water too! Hopefully some of the President's Club Sunday rowing dates might coincide with a trip to
        Christchurch if you live out of town.
      </p>
      <h3>And Off</h3>
      <p>
        Also included in your membership, there is a President's Club morning tea, beer and a barbeque twice a year
        after the Sunday morning paddles. Non-rowing President's Club members are of course welcome to join us.
      </p>
      <p>
        President's Club members will receive news about the club through our via our regular newsletters and
        also receive a complimentary Union Rowing Club emblem in a self-standing frame, ideal for your office desk or
        for wall mounting on first signing up to the club.
