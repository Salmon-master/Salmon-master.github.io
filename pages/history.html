        <p>Union rowing club was founded Tuesday July 26th 1864 as the railway rowing club with 35 original members and
          the colors of white and magenta. All
          of these 35 men were all involved in the clerical branch of the railway industry, in particular the
          construction of the Lyttelton rail tunnel, the founding president, George Holmes, being the contractor
          employed to complete the tunnel after british workers gave up when they hit hard volcanic rock deep in the
          mountain.

        <p>The first club headquarters were in Opawa and a boathouse was erected on the banks of the Heathcote River,
          the shed was completed for the first boat "Eclipse", a four (built by A. McDonald, of Christchurch, a
          boat builder trained in Scotland) which took its maiden voyage on September 17th 1864.</p>

        <p>As completion of the tunnel was nearing, it was realized that membership could be a problem if confined to
          the
          railways service.
          It was announced on 29th August 1866 that the club would be open to all-comers.

          Following a membership increase, the club headquarters were shifted into town and a new boathouse adjacent to
          the
          Canterbury Rowing Club was opened on December 4th 1867 on land that was later to become Oxford Terrace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Railway Rowing Club continued for two years at the new site before it was decided to change its name to
          the
          Union Rowing Club to better reflect its membership.

        <p>
          On 16th March 1887 along with eight other rowing clubs, Union became a founding member of the New Zealand
          Amateur Rowing Association (later to become Rowing New Zealand) and the club's colours were subsequently
          changed to blue and white,
          because of the Amateur Rowing Association's adoption of a colour scheme which gave preference of colours to
          older clubs.
        </p>
        <p> In 1881 the Christchurch city council “called on the two clubs to find other quarters” after deciding to
          build what is now oxford street where the clubs were situated. And so construction began on a new club north
          of Oxford Terrace, Canterbury rowing club also moving directly across the river.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new clubhouse was opened in 1891, but was then subsequently entirely destroyed in a fire on june 23, 1896,
          a tragedy that was to be repeated 116 years later with the arson attack on the leander building in 2012. Union
          rebuilt in the same spot however, and a new double story building was erected and opened by the mayor on
          february 19, 1897. (Photo opposite)

        In 1958, the removal of the Dallington Weir lowered the city river levels and made the town rowing course
        unsuitable so union commenced all rowing at Kerrs Reach in the 1957 -58 season. So the club purchased from the
        NZ Navy a wooden building used as an immigration hostel at Lyttelton, sectionised
        then
        transported it over the Port Hills via Evans Pass and erected it at Kerrs Reach at a cost of $2000.
        The old wooden Union Club building was retained for several years for various uses and then sold to the Arawa
        Canoe
        Club in 1995.</p>

        In 1961 The Christchurch City Council granted a 21 year lease on land at Kerrs Reach for all rowing clubs.
        In 1968 the Union and Canterbury Clubs arranged for the completion of the Leander Club, a joint venture building
        at Kerrs Reach with a ballroom above the boat sheds below, an arrangement reminiscent of the Oxford Terrace
        building.
        Union added a further bay to the ground floor to cater for the increased membership and boat storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Leander building was significantly damaged in the September 2010 and February 2011 earthquakes resulting in
        the building being rendered unusable except for plant storage.
        The club's additional bay was severely structurally compromised in the September quake which necessitated its
        demolition.
        However, only one boat was lost to the earthquake damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The earthquake damage meant all rowing at Kerrs Reach ceased due to health concerns arising from sewage
        contamination of the Avon River.
        Union relocated some of its rowing plant to temporary storage elsewhere in the city and commenced rowing on the
        Kaiapoi and Waimakariri Rivers.
        For most of 2011 and 2012, Union was based on the club trailer with several boats towed to Kaiapoi at weekends
        to be rigged, rowed then de-rigged.
      </p>

      <p>
        On February 25th 2012, the Leander Club building was destroyed by fire in an arson attack.
        For the second time in its history, Union had fallen victim to fire.
        The club lost 17 boats and equipment that was being stored in the building.
        However, once again the club demonstrated its strong powers of recovery.
        The new boathouse was opened on the same site it previously occupied on September 29th 2013 and is a fitting
        milestone in the club's 150 year history.

        <h2>Disaster!</h2>
        <p>
          On June 23rd 1869 fire completely destroyed the Union Club building and rowing plant, a disaster that was to
          be
          repeated again 143 years later in the arson attack at Kerrs Reach in 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the setback, the club opened a new building on the same site in October 1869.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1881 the City Council advised they would be taking the land occupied by the clubs for the formation of
          Oxford
          Terrace. Union moved north to Oxford Terrace and Canterbury moved directly across the river with new
          boathouses
          being built by both clubs.
          On 10th November 1896, the two storey structure that was to serve the club as its Oxford Terrace base for the
          next
          60 years was completed and opened by the Mayor.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 16th March 1887 along with eight other rowing clubs, Union became a founding member of the New Zealand
          Amateur Rowing Association (later to become Rowing New Zealand).
